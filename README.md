## 📌 Project Workflow

1. **Setting Up Azure Resources (ADLS, Azure SQL)**  
   - Provisioned Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS) for scalable storage.  
   - Configured Azure SQL Database for structured data requirements.  

2. **Creating Azure Data Lake Storage (16:43)**  
   - Hierarchical namespace enabled.  
   - Storage layers for **Raw, Cleansed, and Aggregated datasets**.  

3. **Creating Azure Data Factory (21:53)**  
   - Built pipelines for orchestrating and automating data movement.  

4. **Data Ingestion with ADF (22:54)**  
   - Ingested **Parquet/CSV files** into ADLS.  
   - Established staging zones for downstream processing.  

5. **Medallion Architecture in Databricks (33:16)**  
   - **Bronze Layer** → Raw data.  
   - **Silver Layer** → Cleansed and transformed data.  
   - **Gold Layer** → Aggregated, business-ready datasets.  

6. **Advanced Transformations with PySpark (36:56)**  
   - Complex transformations, aggregations, and joins.  
   - Applied optimizations for large-scale processing.  

7. **Building Interactive Power BI Dashboards (1:00:35)**  
   - Designed rich visualizations for analytics and insights.  
   - Published dashboards to Power BI Service for business users.
